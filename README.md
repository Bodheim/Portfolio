# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Task

Build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

Set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search.

If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

The following picture shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
