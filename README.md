# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Task

Built a portfolio page, which I can add to as my experience progresses.

This portfolio uses the basics of html and css and no outside repositories, downloads or APIs were used in this. So this profile is a bare basics profile page.

To see my newer updated page including a more inclusive experience, check out my React based portfolio here: https://github.com/Bodheim/ReactPortfolio
